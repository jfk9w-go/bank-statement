## bank-statement

This simple utility is designed for exporting bank statements from
multiple internet bank accounts.

At the moment Tinkoff and Alfa-Bank are supported.

### Requirements

We use Selenium and Chrome driver for logging on to internet banking accounts,
so these obviously have to be installed.

#### Mac OS (homebrew)
```code:bash
$ brew install selenium-server-standalone chromedriver
```

### Configuration & execution
